# cpp-training
this is the c++ files that i created from the c++ course that showcase some fundamental and basic things of c++ (i will add more comments in the future)
(this is notes that i took from the c++ programming course by freecodecamp so all credits are for them)

this repo is not meant to teach.
this repo is just my personal notes or my learning of c++.
this repo is public for public use if possible.
